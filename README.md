# CFLP-Service-Level-Data
This repository contains the datasets for the paper "Capacitated Facility Location Problem under Uncertainty with Service Level Constraints" by Haoyue Zhanga and Joerg Kalcsics. 

## Random datasets

Stored in ``Random/``, consisting 200 customers and 20 candidate locations in a 500 Ã— 500 area. The seeds used to generate the network is from 1 to 10.
